# OPEN CMS WEB APPLICATION
This project is motivated by the 2024 Web Almanac. With median web pages at over 2MB the internet has become the preserve of the rich. Access to web pages is denied most people in the developing world  because developers and website builders have insisted on creating sites on the assumption that increasingly powerful devices and expansion of 5g networks somehow compensates for their profligacy.

# oracle-to-github-backup
This repository contains data and object definitions backed up daily from an ORACLE "Always Free" OCI database.

The backup is a compressed, encrypted schema export dump file.

Includes DDL metadata extracts of tables, packages and grants.

Includes any APEX applications and static Javascript / CSS files.

Includes any ORDS REST schema.

## Pre-requisites
1. Obtain GITHUB Personal access token (classic) - https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Create credential in "schema-to-backup" referencing the Github account name and token, e.g.

```
begin
  dbms_cloud.create_credential (
    credential_name => 'GITHUB_CRED',
    username        => 'xsf3190',
    password        => '***********'
  ) ;
end;
```
   
## Ideas for Use
1. Provide a secure and reliable off-site backup solution. 
2. Make current and historical code available for easy reference / sharing.
3. Provide an automatic backup / restore cycle betweeen 2 databases.
4. Deploy an environment to test a new Oracle software release.

Note that although Github supports a maximum file size of 100MB, the Advanced Compression option reduces dump file size by an order of magnitude (up to 10 times).

## Install
Logged on to the subject database as ADMIN
1. GRANT READ,WRITE ON DIRECTORY DATA_PUMP_DIR TO "schema-to-backup"
2. GRANT EXECUTE ON DBMS_CLOUD TO "schema-to-backup"
3. GRANT EXECUTE ON DBMS_CLOUD_REPO TO "schema-to-backup"
4. Compile PACKAGE.PCK_BACKUP from this repository in "schema-to-backup"

## Run
For example, to schedule every day at 9PM
```
BEGIN
  DBMS_SCHEDULER.create_job (
    job_name=> 'DAILY_BACKUP',
    job_type=> 'PLSQL_BLOCK',
    job_action=> 'begin pck_backup.daily_backup; end;',
    start_date=> systimestamp,
    repeat_interval=> 'FREQ=DAILY; Interval=1;BYHOUR=21;ByMinute=0',
    enabled =>TRUE,
    auto_drop=>FALSE);
end;
/
```
